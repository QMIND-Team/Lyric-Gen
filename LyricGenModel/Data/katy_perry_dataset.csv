A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth

Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy

1,1,1,Chained to the Rhythm,,"[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion

[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion

4,4,4,Roar,,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath

5,5,5,Never Really Over,,"I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line

Two years, and just like that

Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again

I gotta rewire this brain

6,6,6,Firework,,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""

Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

7,7,7,The One That Got Away,,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it

You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it

And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie

'Cause you representing California (Oh-oh, yeah)

Could my love be enough to stimulate?

Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

12,12,12,I Kissed a Girl,,"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"

I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?
[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa
[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
[Pre-Chorus]

And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

Stole my time, but I'll make up the hours

Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power

And now I'm burning like a blue flame once more

What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back

And you found a better version of me I had never seen
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame

Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open
Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacy"

I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you’re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like ‘Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'"""

And now you're just a ghost

Now I see it clearly
And there’s just a pillow where your head used to sleep

Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind

It doesn’t haunt me at night

Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance
[Pre-Chorus]
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender

But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks now
Don't blame me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You wanna cash out
And get the hell outta town
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are those lights so bright?
Oh, did we get hitched last night?
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don’t call your mother
'Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
Ha, and get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
No, don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
You told me
You told me
Shut up, and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up, and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That’s what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter
Gimme some cash out, baby
Gimme some cash out, baby"

I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better
Better luck in the sack
No formal education
And I swore way too much
But I swear you didn't care

So as I write this letter
And shed my last tear
It's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window, oh, oh
Can anybody see? Is anybody waving back at me?

68,68,68,Fingerprints,,"Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75 isn't worth an hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than a X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle, no oh
Oh, I can't settle
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight

My life I took it from the back to the front
Rosa parks
Who cares what they blink or they bought
Who cares what they think or they thought
Baby we can do it in the car
In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park
I'm here to play with that little bitty thing
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these little players, acting like they can hate
But they can not
Can't, won't, don't, never will, be real
One, two, three, four times, Cypress hill
Hey Ms. Perry
Looking sexy with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic, I'm maverick, top gun
If you look and look no further you got one
I got 'em confused
Is he Hispanic or is he Caucasian?
Don't worry about where I'm from
Just know one thing, I'm amazing

Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string, for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again
Because you're not a man

I wish you could feel that my love is real, but you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man
If the past is the problem, our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end, you'll be a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, oh
Toy...

These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
With each scar, there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave of an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

Aw, let’s go!

It’s a Friday night, now here we go
I ain’t no stripper, but I work the pole
Bartender, can you pour some mo'?
And I’m so tipsy, coming out my clothes
Fly high, high, high, and I can’t see, so I can’t drive
I party 'til I’m out my mind
I kiss on him, but he don’t mind
Then I wake up in the morn
I got a guy in my bed, like: ""Hello, good morn""
Don’t remember how I got him home
But Friday night, it was nice and long
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa

But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots

Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled

Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again
So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes
Just watching you react
When you're depressed you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

80,80,80,I Think I’m Ready,,"I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just the friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I want to argue, but there is nothing to say
Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it
(Ready for it)
Oh, love, I think I'm ready
'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah, we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way
But, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it

Oh, love, I think I'm ready, ready for it

I can't let go and not know
Don't know the way ahead of me
One day at a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
That I could hand over the keys
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I've jumped and I got no regret
You're my co-pilot, yeah that’s right
Now I can just enjoy the ride
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map (life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)
I know we're finally falling
Cause I was giving you half no more than
My hand's in the air while you're driving
This is living, this is living, this is living
Oh it's beautiful, beautiful
Being with you, being with you
I'll let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
But we'll see more without a map
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)
Without a map, without a map, without a map (life is beautiful, life is beautiful, life is beautiful)"

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention (Look)
[Rap Verse 1: MIMS]
Since my girl kissed a girl
I guess I can do the same thang
Call me John Witherspoon
Bedroom
Bang-bang
Me and Mrs. Jane-Jane
Watch us do our thang
They say I only name one
But they both got the same name (Same name)
They call me Big Daddy, but I ain't Cane/Kane
I got a homeless personality
I can't change
I mean I'm so on top, it's like another world
I am MIMS
A.K.A
Mr. My-Girl-Kissed-Another-Girl
(Verse 1)
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what
I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
Chorus: Katy Perry
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
(Verse 2)
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
Repeat Chorus
Bridge: Katy Perry
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to
Deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
[Rap Verse 2: MIMS]
My Girl Gotta Girlfriend, she said she kissed a girl
Won't fill me no details, cause she don't, kiss and tell
Man, I'm in a different world
Is this heaven, is this hell
Some say I'm a lucky man like I fell into a wishing well
Even though I'm livin' well
Somethin' just ain't sittin' well
She gettin' more play than me
Every night, it's a different girl
But I don't mind it
I find it
Somethin' sort of excitin'
My girl kissed a girl, and guess what
She liked it (Liked it)

Teenage Dream

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die

Warm, wet and wild

But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

The One That Got Away

Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)
[Verse: Katy Perry]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
This a hickie or a bruise?
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
[Chorus​​: Katy Perry]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh whoa
[Post-Chorus: Katy Perry]
But this Friday night, do it all again
This Friday night, do it all again

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
E.T
[Verse: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Firework
[Verse: Katy Perry]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"
87,87,87,Box,,"I was living in a small mind
With no lifeline
And no messages can reach me from the outside
When I looked out over the horizon
Didn't notice the sun was setting or just rising
Then it hit me
Maybe bit me
Then I knew, quite a few would not go with me
I didn't know exactly where I would be going
But I had to let this river in me flowing
What a ride
When you open your eyes
For the very first time
A real surprise
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive
I was living on a fault line
The fault was all mine
And this unstable ground found me down half the time
But I had enough
I had to get up
I had to shrug it all off 'cause it's the same old stuff
Then it hit me
You won't permit me
To be an individual
Just doesn't fit me
But I decided that it's going to be living
Yeah, I decided I'm escaping from your prison
[Pre-Chorus]
What a high
When you open your mind for the very first time
A real surprise
I started living outside of the box
Crossing over lines where I always used to stop
Living outside of the box
'Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water, every moment I'm alive
So long conformity
And ambiguity is a new priority
All it takes, for heaven sakes
Is to figure out the face and learn to separate
I started living outside of the box
Taking my time when I always used to rush
Living outside of the box
Cause I'm not gonna be anybody that I'm not
I always knew this day would come
When I broke down the walls for my liberation
I've been living on the other side
Come hell or high water every moment I'm alive
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside of the box
Oh, living outside
Ha ha ha
I always knew this day would come
When I got off my back, found some motivation
Oh, living outside of the box
Of the box, of your life
Of everything that seems nice
Oh, living outside of the box"
88,88,88,The One That Got Away (Acoustic),,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, (the one), the one, (the one)
The one, the one, the one, the one, the one
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

I'll be here for you

That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy can't you just get used to something so right?

Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming

That as for some involvement, that as for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb

Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot, but I say why not

It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop

So many things I shouldn't be saying now
You know, I like my boys a little bit older
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
All my girls are nowhere to be found
They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around
The undercover lovers under the covers
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove
I just wanna use your lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-ove, lo-uh-uh-uh-ove
Trying to stop my head from spinning
Too much to drink, not making sense
It's been a while since I've been with someone new
That I can't stop the way I'm feeling
As you leave, please could you just close the door
Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll find a shoulder to cry upon
I just wanna use your love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love
(Oh, I just wanna use your love, baby)
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I can't keep my hips from swaying to his sweet melody
You see, I fell in love, with my rock-rock god

He said ""Hey girl, can't you live your life right?""
Father, things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone 'cause I'm not alone

I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels cryin' over me

Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures
I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?

And they claim you can barely read
But you say ""Don't bother me with all of your reality""

Life should be that simple

I wish it were just so simple

You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems
So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's

The situations
The opportunities

That it's as simple as it seems
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with it"

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

All I wanted was to have some fun

She stood me down, but she had to look up
Then she started to lose control
What can I say?
That's rock and roll

Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong

I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
[Verse 3: Katy Perry]
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
[Verse 4: B.o.B]
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away"
113,113,113,Wish You The Worst,,"I saw you at the grocery store
Oh you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost, of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot how to pick 'em
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well this looks like the end
Yeah, I hope we can still be friends
Congratulations
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between, heading no where fast
Sure it's gonna last forever
Let me be the first to wish you the worst
'Cause I think you deserve each other
Let me be the curse that creeps under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do"

And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you

Hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh

Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me?
Two o'clock and I'm still driving 'round your block
Feeling a little crazy
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
He bought me a big ring, we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing
Up at my place
Not surprising
We both play this game
You're underneath my street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la

So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me
I listen to these voices
Or is it this house that's giving me chills
As I lie upon this little girl's bed?
Who's at the door? Who's walking near?
Or has my imagination spilled?
This little girl all grown up still fears
Oh, and I cry
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold me
Where can I go, where can I hide
From these evil sufferings?
Oh, these images painted on my walls
They say there's a place that I can
Hide in the shadow of your wings
Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge
No more tears
So hold me close
For I'm so tired of holding myself
So very tired and tired, tired and tired
Just hold, hold me close

You gotta believe us, it’s all for the best

Some things you can't tell your sister ’cause she's still too young
Yeah you'll understand

118,118,118,The Better Half Of Me,,"I took advantage of you
A stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it
I said 'Fine, good luck replacing this'
Cause I seem strong and independent
Self sufficient, confident
And I'm like Mercury rising to the top so selfishly
The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one
So please accept my apology
Cause I'm feeling like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
That you're the catch I want to keep
Cause I get weak thinking about you
Living without you life has no value
Baby, come back to me
Cause you're the only missing piece
Cause the better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without its bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one
Ooh, it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me so consistently
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings, without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind you
That two is stronger than one
The better half of me, oh it's you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I've gottafind ya, gotta remind you

I'm gonna love you because two is better than one"

Is not what you had
In mind for me

Is so hard
I cling to what I see

Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I'll ever need is You
Here in this haze a distant light
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears
[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You're piercing me
This self will bleed
You're killing all
Of my securities

That all I'll ever need is You
You're piercing me

120,120,120,Part of Me (Demo Version),,"Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Now look at me, I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t never put me out again
I’m glowing, oh whoa
You can keep the dog for me
I never liked him anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

So crystal clear

But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached
Is where it's at..
For the moment
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Yeah, I play cool
Like i've met a hundred yous
And for tonight
You're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh you wrap me up
In your arms and I just.. melt away
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
Oh if I could tell you everything
I feel for you baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would, you know I would
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh baby relax
Oh baby lay back

122,122,122,The Driveway,,"Remember last summer
Under the shooting stars?
We made a wish were together forever
And let nobody tear us apart
And how fun was that ride down to Mexico?
We took a chance on those road side tacos
And we got sick by the side of the road
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And the fall came
And we had that big pot lot party;
And your little sixteen year old brother
Spilt wine all over my carpet
And I got mad, you thought it was funny
I stayed mad all winter;
It's so sad
A thing like that
Becomes such a splinter
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
I'm almost twenty-three
And I'm barely hanging on
I can't keep crashing couches
And going to sleep at dawn
And when were you going to take me somewhere that I can dress up?
Where we can act grown up
Do you ever wanna clean up?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We share a car, you thought it was okay
You couldn't have cut it closer
I'm sick of it, this is it;
And now the party's over
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same, and
The story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
Someday, you'll make, some girl, happy;
I know, you'll get though
You'll know, just what, to say, to do;
Because I showed you
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So, I guess the driveway
Is the end of the road
For us it's too, late
Let the credits start to roll
Let the credits start to roll
Oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I guess the driveway; will be the end of the road"
123,123,123,Growing Pains,,"You would think that I could find
A simple song, a photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PhD
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me, you'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways (As the wisest of men)
Oh perhaps some day but for now I'm grateful
To be a part of the family tree
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
Time after time, one more time and again
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old, I am told it's the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying
[Pre-Chorus]
What I am trying to say, hey
I'm just a babe in so many ways
Still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life, so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
Oh, baby don't worry about a thing
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Thank you"

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you

In a magazine
We laughed out loud

In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said ""All the world's a stage""
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me
I don't need champagne

No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now and then
On a Friday night, cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late

You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion, sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys oh, yes they will
They don't want to define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow, so if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants
And your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
I can't cook, no but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat as I kiss
Your forehead, this may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing your tail
Quick fix won't ever get you well
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Put the bottle down

Wanna miss out"

I’ll let it miss so you don't assume
Please tell me that you want me, you need me
Doesn't matter if you don’t believe me
I have no one to call me baby
Sure is sad no one calls you lately
I try to run but I don't know how to get there
Keep on running you're going nowhere
You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears
I just need a man who will stay
You can save it for a rainy day
Won't you help me get my life on track?
I'd oblige but you stabbed me in back
Ride with me, I'm headed south
I can't believe a single word from your mouth
You and me are like biscuits and gravy
Now I know that you're crazy
You fear the sunrise, you can dry your eyes, your crocodile tears
Can’t believe a word you say
You can save it for a rainy day
Had to tell you not once, but twice
You need to take your own advice"

Trapped in our white picket fence

Where nothing will ever be enough?

Fit the moment?

All I could say
Is what do I do?

Throw us away

Of our vacation's
Chewed up in the drawer
Beside me
She thinks I never got
To watch it
I'm so glad
I made a copy
The sky
Got bitter twisted
Just like you and me
I miss it
You snap it
Bend it
Burn it
Then you find
That you can't fix it
Fall back on whatever
Still remains
Breaking you in
Breaking your heart
I was taking it all
And I tore you apart
Breaking me in
Breaking my heart
And the damage was done
But I took what you got
We were breaking' it
Smashing' it
Taking' it
Loving' it
Hating' it
Driving' it home

Now I'm all alone

Could you be the devil?

Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
[Pre-Hook + Hook]

I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

Katy, you gon' create a monster, fucking with an alien
Cause once you let me in, your world will never be the same again
We invading USA, the Russians and Australians
Cause we keep the radio active, uranium
Landed in a pod in Little Britain, David Walliams
Now I'm in your Sun, your Star, your Mirror and your Mail again
I'm Saville Row ten remixed with vintage Nike blazers
I can read your body language like you just came out of LA Ink
Caps lock, baby, cause I'm all about my capital
I think so irrational, I'm big international
All my raps is factual, I'm so supernatural
And I've been fly a very long time, terminators

134,134,134,High and the Lows,,"[Katy Perry]:
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all
Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows
[Mickey Avalon]:
Preacher Mcgrath was always eager to ask
Why his mother rubbed her hands
Beneath his pants at mass
And if he missed a prayer he best beware her wrath
'Cause moms would whip his a** to keep him on the path
To the son and the father plus the holy ghost
Run for cover or she bust his nose
Behind closed doors he dressed in hookers clothes
And shoot *** on his catechism
Listen close
One day he got married to a bird named Peresphone
Who died giving birth to his only child Stephanie
Whose destiny was flawed
Undeserved because God made her father a filthy perv
[Katy Perry]:
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all
Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows
[Mickey Avalon]:
Little Steph used to be so innocent
Now she never slept from all the crystal meth
Her papa was a preacher so she knew the good book
And when he tucked her into bed
He fondled the nook
But baby look good in the Honda Accord
With the chest pressed up against the dashboard
A pocket full of cash and a bottle of coors
Rev the throttle hit the gas and nash on the floor
Toward the end of the night
Steph would go to score
And when the dealer dished it out she hit him up for more
A bag of skittle for the baby while Steph gets crazy
From a shot to the neck
Hot we and hazy
Lady of the Eve maybe shed be in better health
If her father learned to keep his hands to himself
[Katy Perry]:
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all
Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows
[Mickey Avalon]:
Norm was born to Stephanie in '73
He became a therapist real swift with the ladies
As a baby he was brought to cop with moms
He got his face filled with candy while she marked her arms
A long shot from the start but the kid was smart
He would hit the books while the other hit the yard
He started breaking hearts back in Junior High
'Cause Norm could stop 'em dead in their tracks with his eyes
Fiercely piercing past their thighs and into the stars
Hello, goodbye
College was a breeze got A's and B's and never missed a single party
He opened up his practice in the deep deep south
And helped damaged debutantes ease their woes on his couch
[Katy Perry]:
You gotta take the highs with the lows
Sometimes its just how it goes
And when your down to nothing at all
Its always predictable
Postpone your broken dreams
While flipping through the pages of a magazine
You gotta take the highs with the lows"

Oh, oh
Save me when I rip the cord
And hang on so I don't get bored
And pull me when I kiss the ground
It's so nice to know you
Go 'head, you can chase the light
Kick back when it gets too bright
'Cause my world is another world
I'd, I'd like to show you

Hello?
Hi, it's me, can I come over?
Sometimes I want a shot of your Novocaine
I think I found the switch that turns off the brain
Locate the black hole that I can jump right through
'Cause my ears, they won't stop ringing
I won't stand another pick up line
Oh, my heart, it will stop beating
If I don't see you tonight
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Just don't hang up
Just, just don't hang up
Running away is not the solution
My head's not straight with all this pollution
Electronic gadgets add to the confusion
So, are you on your own?
Or should I take a rain check?
Now am I going home?
Or will I cry my eyes out?
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Don't hang up
There wouldn't be so much to say
If I wasn't in this all to stay
Is it too late
For us to communicate?
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
Don't hang up
'Cause I want you way too much
Out of luck
Because you're too far for me to touch
Don't hang up
Because I need you way too much"

But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the..."
144,144,144,Naturally,,"Did it seem to disappoint you, living alone?
By the banks of your dilemma, out of control
No one seems to give the answers, that you wanna hear
What you'd give to find a welcome here
Miles and miles of lies behind you, those were the days
So many lives you'd hope would guide you, help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise that they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry these bitter tears
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you
Heaven waits the hours of silence, finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender of peace
All the years of searching for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found a welcome home
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you
I love you, I have
And I always will
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say
Did it come naturally? You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own
Always remember that it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you"
145,145,145,Time’s Up,,"I've played the song
Now it drives me crazy
I've run the race
Now I'm too damn lazy
This love of ours
Is a fading photograph
Yeah-heah, yeah-heah
[Pre-Chorus]
Now am I supposed to
Laugh today
Seems a little different
Hard to say
But it looks like the end
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone
We've surfed the wave
Now we've hit the shore
And we've squeezed the fruit
Till there's no more juice left
We're both so good
Good at keeping up the lie
Yeah-heah, yeah-heah
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey but no one's got to
Die, we can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone
As I'm waving you goodbye
I want you to smile
Save a picture in your frame
File it right next to my name
I'm willing to die
For love willing to try
But not willing to lie for love
I know that this cake's already baked
Now its burning, burning
We can
Get it in prospective
Kiss my lips
Life is what we make it
Time's up
Promise this time I'm getting off
Better we slam the door shut
Didn't you know if nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
(even when it's gone)
Promise this time I'm getting off
(even when it's gone)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Yeah yeah yeah
Even when it's gone
Even when it's gone
If nothing changes
Nothing changes
Time's up
(even when)
Promise this time I'm getting off
(even when)
Better we turn the lights off
Love is a train
We wait for it
Even when it's gone"
146,146,146,Spit,,"If You came by me
Would I crown You my King
Or brush You off as though
I really didn't see
If You walked by my side
Would our souls then be unified
I swore Your name
Would never be denied
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
But time and time again
I'd live that life of sin
I knew it hurt you bad
But I wasn't ready to give in
Maybe someday
But not this day I said
I wanted to live my life
I was willing to pay the price
But I took up this hammer
And laughed at all Your slander
And pierced Your hands
With the nails of blasphemy
How could I do this? I don't know
Said something forced me to it, so
Spit in Your face and passed You by
('Cause I'd forgotten those words
Your name won't be denied)
But looking into my eyes
I knew You felt this heart's cry
I needed You
Bad my life was oh so sad
But looking back at all this pain
This guilt, this strife
Would You take it all away
If I were to give you back my life?
But You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
He was hanging on a cross
With a crown of thorns
In His head
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee
And You said
I've forgiven thee"
147,147,147,Thinking of You (Acoustic),,"Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test
[Pre-Chorus 2]
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...
You're the best
And yes, I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it, I was burned
Oh, I think you should know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What you would do if...
You were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Won't you walk through
And bust in the door and take me away?
Yeah, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I want to stay
Oh-oh, woah-oh, woah
Stay"

Part II: Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're going to stop-op, oh woah
But this Friday night, do it all again

No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise
But still, I rise
Don't be surprised, I will still rise"
