0,0,0,Wish You Were Here,,"— And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here

1,1,1,Time,,"[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones besid
E the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells"
2,2,2,Comfortably Numb,,"Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave"

Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?

With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy

No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Can you help me?

And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?
[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

12,12,12,Dogs,,"You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone
(Stone, stone, stone...)
Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone"

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter

The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old"

Stand still, Laddy!
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would hurt the children
In any way they could (oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids (*Laughs*)
But in the town, it was well known when they got home at night Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives

I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (fly to.. fly to.. fly to..)
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
(""Surprise, surprise, surprise..."")
There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots"

Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya? Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?"

In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waitin' for the worms to come
Testing. One. Two. One. Two. We’re all going to convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going...

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes

Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you as you claw the thin ice"

Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

You pick the place and I’ll choose the time
And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you’ve said today
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns ’round
Frowning
And who’s the fool who wears the crown?
And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There’s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can’t keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I"

Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse

44,44,44,The Final Cut,,"Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)
(Yahoo!)
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

I’d give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things
I’ve got a cloak it’s a bit of a joke
There’s a tear up the front
It’s red and black, I’ve had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things
I know a mouse, and he hasn’t got a house
I don’t know why I call him Gerald
He’s getting rather old, but he’s a good mouse
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things
I’ve got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They’re on the dish
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world

If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do"
67,67,67,Wearing the Inside Out,,"From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn’t recognize I’d become
No more than alive; I’d barely survive
In a word… overrun
Won’t hear a sound (He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long (With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (…curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile
I’m creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out
Look at him now
He’s paler somehow
But he’s coming around
He’s starting to choke
It’s been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth
And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again
I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)
I’m with you now (He’s torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again"
68,68,68,On The Turning Away,,"On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
""Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away""
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be?
No more turning away?

69,69,69,A Great Day for Freedom,,"On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there’s a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away...
Slipped away"
70,70,70,The Gunner’s Dream,,"Floating down, through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And in the corner of some foreign field
I had a dream
I had a dream
Good-bye Max
Good-bye Ma
After the service, when you’re walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!
A place to stay
“Oi! A real one …”
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what’s more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don’t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
And no one kills the children anymore
Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What’s done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed"

Hey you
Did you ever realize what you’d become?
And did you see
That it wasn’t only me you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes
The rain fell slow
Down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you
And the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know?

77,77,77,When the Tigers Broke Free,,"It was just before dawn one miserable
Morning in black Forty-Four
When the forward commander was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks
Held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives
And kind old King George sent Mother a note
When he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
With gold leaf and all
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground
When the Tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z
They were all left behind
Most of them dead, the rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me"

Sinking behind bridges in the road

That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it’s day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck (“Oh no!”)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear And you’ll never hear their voices (""Daddy, Daddy!"")
And you’ll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds,  foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius”"

Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
With their favourite toys

Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did
For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls, the waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low
And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die"

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

Turn my lead into gold

And I think I’m growing old

Stone after stone

Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callin’
“If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home”
Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I’m drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I’ll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day
If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home
And I pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Diggin’ for gold in a hole in my hand
Open a book, take a look at the way things stand
And you’re leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
And if you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home"

He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining, dining
Biding his time

And I push her to the limit to see if she will break

You find your eyes are growing moist

Say you have to make your final choice
Who are you and who am I

Some are born; some men die

Shine on you crazy diamond!
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond!
You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!
Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, and sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!"

99,99,99,What Shall We Do Now?,,"What shall we use
To fill the empty
Spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the East?
Contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all?
With our backs to the wall"
100,100,100,Chapter 24,,"All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune

Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

104,104,104,Cymbaline,,"The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
It’s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size
And it’s high time! (high time), Cymbaline

Took a cruiser with all hands
Apparently, to make him give it back"
107,107,107,The Scarecrow,,"The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn’t care
He stood in a field where barley grows
His head did no thinking
His arms didn’t move except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he’s resigned to his fate
‘Cause life’s not unkind – he doesn’t mind
He stood in a field where barley grows"

Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape
When I was their age all the lights went out
There was no time to whine or mope about
And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at angels one five
Though they’ll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good
‘Cause that’s the only time that I can really speak to you
And there is something that I’ve locked away
A memory that is too painful
To withstand the light of day
When we came back from the war
The banners and flags hung on everyone’s door
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang
But the burning in my heart
The memory smolders on
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom"
109,109,109,One of the Few,,"When you’re one of the few to land on your feet

Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask

You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
“I’ll tell you what, I’ll give you three blacks, and play you for five""
Behind petrified eyes
“Ta! You was unlucky there son”
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory
Now you’re lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide
“Time gentleman!”
Behind brown and mild eyes
“Oi!”"

With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world… One world
Invisible transfers, long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and they're gonna smash it down
One world… One world
One world… One world
The dogs of war don’t negotiate
The dogs of war won’t capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they’ve been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change you know the dogs remain
One world, it’s a battleground
One world, and we gonna smash it down
One world… One world
One world… One world

Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
(Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes)

The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band"

Gotta keep your shoes and your car clean
Gotta keep smiling, you gotta keep fit
You gotta keep drinking, you gotta eat shit
You gotta be small to be a big shot
Gotta eat meat to stay at the top
You gotta be trusted, you gotta tell lies
Gotta be able to narrow your eyes
You gotta believe they gotta believe you
Gotta appear easy to see through
Gotta be sure you look good on TV
Gotta resemble a human being
You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
Gonna get harder as you get older
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand
Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer
[David Gilmour's scat singing]
[Verse 2: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour Harmonies)
And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down
All alone
Dragged down by the stone
You've gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
Gotta divide the tame from the sick
Gotta keep all of us docile and fit
Gotta keep everyone buying this shit
They gotta get you started early
Processed by the time you're thirty
You work like fuck until you're sixty-five
And time's your own until you die
Gotta admit to a lot of confusion
Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist this creeping malaise
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending
You can tell a sucker from a friend
But you still raise the knife
Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike
[Verse 4: Roger Waters] (David Gilmour and Rick Wright backup)
Who was born in a house full of pain
Born in a house full of pain
Who was sent out to play on his own
Sent out to play on his own
Who was raised on a diet of shame
Raised on a diet of shame
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with bridle and bit
Fitted with bridle and bit
Who was given a seat in the stand
Given a seat in the stand
Who was forcing his way to the rail
Forcing his way to the rail
Who was offered a place on the board
Offered a place on the board
Who was only a stranger at home
Only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Dragged down by the stone"
116,116,116,Free Four,,"One, two, free, four!
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less
So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you’ll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, ’cause I know
You may find it hard to get off
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man’s son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die"
117,117,117,Southampton Dock,,"They disembarked in 45
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line
Gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with the hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again
And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made, but
In the bottom of our hearts we felt the final cut"
118,118,118,Talkin’ Hawkin’,,"Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible

Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land

Laughter in his sleep
Sister’s throwing stones, hoping for a hit

Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain to try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you good-bye

122,122,122,One Slip,,"A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend
""I will, I will"" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won’t forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
One regret, you will never forget
There’ll be no sleep in here tonight
One slip… one slip…"
123,123,123,Grantchester Meadows,,"“Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain”
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea"

Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?
So I've changed my gear, and I find my knees
And I covered them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
They don't make long of my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all the lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am
Vegetable man
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can

Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graves
Yellow bird, you are not lone

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later"

Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people, she's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye, then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you
Thought you might like to know
I'm her lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side, feeding ducks in the afternoon tide

Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands
And thousands and...

Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back

I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in...
People pushing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate
Point me at the sky and let it fly

Point me at the sky and let it fly

Nobody cry, it's goodbye

When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while
Like tears left like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly
Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands in the sun
I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye
She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down"

One kiss, one single kiss

A man who ran: a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed
The use of force, he was so tough
She’ll soon submit, she’s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He’s just the same as all the rest
He’s not the worst, and he’s not the best
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun"
131,131,131,Questions for Assorted Lunatics,,"“People often ask me about the voices on Dark Side. I was trying to gather audio snippets to mix into segues on Dark Side. Rather than interviewing people I came up with the idea of writing a series of questions on cards. The cards would be in a stack on a conductors stand in front of a mike. We would scour Abbey Road Studios for willing guinea pigs, bring them to the studio, sit them down, roll tape and then ask them to respond to each card in order.
As I recall the first card was something irrelevant and innocuous, like “What’s your favourite colour?” and the last was the more enigmatic “What do you think of The Dark Side Of The Moon?”
I can’t remember the ones in between, except for:
Are you afraid of dying?
When were you last violent?
Were you in the right?
Do you ever think you’re going mad?
If so why?
End of Story.”"

To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning
And if you want to stay for a little bit

I don’t care if we get there on time
Everybody’s searching for something, they say
I’ll get my kicks on the way
Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don’t change

Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down
It's time to dig another one

And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave"

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Flat tops of houses, mouses, houses
Fiddle and Diddle sitting bat tat tat
Watching the telly till all hours - telly time!
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket"
138,138,138,Paintbox,,"Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink (Drink – a – drink – a – drink – a – drink)
(Ah)
What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
They're in the scene I should have been
Far away (Away – away – away – away – away)
Getting up, I feel as if I’m remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget
The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do? – I can’t think what to say
She sees through anyway (Away – away – away – away – away)
Out of the front door I go
Traffic’s moving rather slow
Arriving late
There she waits, looking very angry
As cross as she can be (Be – a – be – a – be – a – be – a – be)
Getting up, I feel as if I’m remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget"
139,139,139,Shine On You Crazy Diamond (part 2),,"Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and i'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!"

141,141,141,Embryo,,"All this love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show"

143,143,143,Crying Song,,"We smile and smile
We smile and smile
Laughter echoes in your eyes
We climb and climb
We climb and climb
Footfalls softly in the pines
We cry and cry
We cry and cry
Sadness passes in a while
We roll and roll
We roll and roll
Help me roll away the stone"

146,146,146,A New Machine (Part 1),,"I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way that it's always been?
Could it ever have been different?
Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever"
147,147,147,Candy and a Currant Bun,,"Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......
Oooh, don't talk to me
Please just fuck with me
Please you know I'm feeling frail
It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon
Oooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail
Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very very very frail
Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......"

149,149,149,Butterfly,,"Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out
Sometimes when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
Cause it drives my me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly
I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love
I won’t write your name
In Latin in a frame
Cause framing is a chain
Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out"
