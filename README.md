# Lyric-Gen
Created by Jacob Seiler, James McCarron, Ted Brownlow, and Joshua Neizer.

Do you have the musical talent of Freddie Mercury, but the lyrical talent of a sock?

Fear no moreâ€”our team is building a deep learning algorithm to generate song lyrics given a key term and genre. Specifically, we will be using a recursive neural network for the lyric generation model, and a convolutional neural network for the genre detection model. The data we will use for our algorithm will be scraped from a dataset of songs and the Genius API. We are also planning to deploy a web API and web application that will interact with our lyric gen. algorithm.
